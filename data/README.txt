# out/dt[rf]_cm:
These are the files generated along with the classification of decision tree(dt) and random forest(rf). They are used to draw the confusion matrix diagram.

# out/dt[rf]_predict_class_[1,2,3,4].vectors:
These files are the classification results of decision tree(dt) and random forest(rf). The number 1,2,3,4 are correponding to different classes, where 1 stands for traffic, 2 stands for sports, 3 stands for disaster, 4 stands for festival.

# out/nn_cm:
These are the files generated along with the classification of neural network. They are used to draw the confusion matrix diagram.

# out/nn_predict_class_[1,2,3,4].vectors:
These files are the classification results of neural network. The number 1,2,3,4 are correponding to different classes, where 1 stands for traffic, 2 stands for sports, 3 stands for disaster, 4 stands for festival.

These pictures are visualization grpahs of the confusion matrixs according to each classifier's results. The darker the color is, the high rate it is.
